To renew their brand image, [the French design agency Murmure](https://murmure.me/) has decided to base their remodeling on a custom-designed typeface: Le Murmure (“The Murmure” in French). [Studio Triple](http://studiotriple.fr/) designer [Jérémy Landes](https://velvetyne.fr/authors/jjjlllnnn/) has developed an especially distinctive, editorial and elegant font, which has been complemented by surprising stylistic variations.

Jérémy has lent an attentive ear to create a typeface in line with Murmure's image. Le Murmure font plays on a skillful mismatch between characters, creating a unique rhythm which carries our voice. This fruitful and enriching collaboration strengthens Murmure’s graphic and collaborative vision to undertake singular and sensitive projects.

Used as a titling font, its height and the stability of its shapes lend it elegance, whilst details inspired by calligraphy and technique reveal all of Murmure’s notions of experimentation, research and creativity. Le Murmure is a typeface devoid of serifs which combines effectiveness, legibility and singularity. Its highly condensed proportions draw their inspiration from magazine titling fonts and add the editorial dimension the agency wished to endow their new identity with.

This typeface comes with many glyph variations, meaning alternate letters drawn in an even more original way. Here lies infinite potential which the users will take great delight in exploiting through a random opentype function.
